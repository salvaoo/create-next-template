# Create next template

`create next template` is a CLI tool to create a Next.js template with [shadcn/ui](https://twitter.com/shadcn) components.

> Both templates are updated to the latest version of Next.js (13.4)

## Options

- The `TypeScript` template is generated from [here](https://github.com/salvaoo/Next-template-typescript).
- The `JavaScript` template is generated from [here](https://github.com/salvaoo/Next-template-javascript)

You also can choose a name for your project.

## Usage

You can run this CLI with `npx`, 

```bash
npx @salvagr/create-next-template
```

When you ran the command, you will be asked to choose between `TypeScript` or `Javascript` template. After that, you will be asked to choose a name for your project. 

The CLI will create a folder with the name you have chosen, clone the template inside it and **clean** up the git folder.
