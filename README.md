# Create next template

`create next template` is a CLI tool to create a Next.js template from [@shadcn/next-template](https://github.com/shadcn/next-template). This CLI give you a choice to choose between `pages` or `app` template.

[@shadcn/next-template](https://github.com/shadcn/next-template) is a template for Next.js projects build with `pages` structure (stable). I have created a version of this template with `app` structure (experimental) and I added it to this CLI.

> Note: The app template is a fork of [@shadcn/next-template](https://github.com/shadcn/next-template). You can find the fork [here](https://github.com/salvaoo/next-template).

## Usage

You can run this CLI with `npx`, 

```bash
npx @salvagr/create-next-template
```

When you ran the command, you will be asked to choose between `pages` or `app` template. After that, you will be asked to choose a name for your project. The CLI will create a folder with the name you have chosen and download the template inside it.
